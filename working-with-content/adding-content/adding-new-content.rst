Adding New Content
=======================

A general overview of how to add new content items in Plone, including
definitions of each standard content type

New content items are added via the **Add New . . .** drop-down menu:

Adding content in Plone is done *placefully,*which is to say that you
must navigate to the section of your Plone website that you wish the new
content to reside before you use the **Add New . . .** drop-down menu.
You can of course cut, copy, and paste content items from one section to
another if necessary.

Content Types
-------------

In Plone, you can use a number of **Content Types** to post certain kinds
of content. For example, to upload an image you must use the **Image**
content type. Below is a list of the available content types in order of
their appearance, and what each are used for:

Collection
    Collections are used to group and display content based on a set of
    **criteria** which you can set. Collections work much like a query
    does in a database.
Event
    An Event is a special page-like content type specifically for
    posting information about an event (such as a fundraiser, barbecue,
    etc).Â This content type has a function which allows the site
    visitor to add the event to their desktop calendar with either the
    iCal or vCal standard. This includes applications such as: Google
    Calendar, Outlook, Sunbird and others.
    To add a single event to your calendar, click on the vCal or iCal
    links next to the "Add event to calendar" text in the main view of
    the event item.

    From Plone 3.3 on you can also get all the events in a folder in
    one go (currently only available in iCal format). To download the
    iCal file, append *@@ics\_view* to the end of the URL of the folder
    that contains the events. For example, if you want to get all the
    events into the *events* folder in the root of your site, go to
    *http://example.com/events/@@ics\_view*.

File
    A File in Plone is any binary file you wish to upload with the
    intent that it can be downloaded by your site visitors. Common
    examples are PDFs, Word Documents, and spreadsheets.
Folder
    Folders work in Plone much like they do on your computer. You can
    use folders to organize your content, and to give your Plone website
    a navigation structure.
Image
    The Image content type is used for uploading image files (JPG, GIF,
    PNG) so that you can insert them into pages or other page-like
    content types.
Link
    Also referred to as the 'Link Object'; do not confuse this with the
    links you create via TinyMCE or Kupu, Plone's visual page editors.
    The Link content type is often used to include a link to an external
    website in Navigation and other specialized uses.
News Item
    This content type is similar to Event, only News Item is
    specifically for posting news. You can also attach a thumbnail image
    to a News Item, which then appears in folder summary views next to
    the summary of the News Item.
Page
    A Page in Plone is one of the most simple content types available.
    Use Pages to write the bulk of your web pages on your Plone website.

Note: Depending on what add-on products you have installed, you may see
more options in your **Add New . . .** drop-down menu than appear here.
For information about those additional content types, refer to the
Product documentation for the add-on in question.

Title
-----

Nearly all content types in Plone have two fields in common: **Title**
and **Description.**

The **Title** of content items, including folders, images, pages, etc.,
can be anything you want -- you can use any keyboard characters,
including blanks. **Titles** become part of web address for each item
you create in Plone. Web addresses, also known as URLs, are what you
type in a web browser to go to a specific location in a web site (Or,
you would click your way there), such as:

www.mysite.com/about/personnel/sally/bio

or

www.mysite.com/images/butterflies/skippers/long-tailed-skippers

Web addresses *do* have restrictions on allowed keyboard characters, and
blanks are not allowed. Plone does a good job of keeping web addresses
correct by using near-equivalents of the **Title** that you provide, by
converting them to lowercase, and by substituting dashes for spaces and
other punctuation.

The web address of a given item is referred to as the **short name** in
Plone. When you use the **Rename** function, you'll see the short name
along with the title.

The fields will vary according to the content type. For instance, the
Link content type has the URL field. The File content type has the File
field, and so on.

Description
-----------

The **Description** appears at the top of pages, just under the Title.
Descriptions are often used to conjunction with a variety of Folder and
Collection views (such as Standard and Summary). The Description also
appears in search results via Plone's native search engine.

The Description is just plain text, without any form of mark-up. This is to keep it inline with :term:`Dublin Core` standards.
